to do list:

make "save" and "load" options

make item shop
    somehow prevent the same person from selling the same item over and over again

make quests, and quest givers.
    This includes interfaces for viewing which quests you have
	and also , some "mechanism" for whether or not it's completed. similar to dungeon_mechanics
	
make a "progress" indicator. don't allow repeat clears of dungeons
    still allow repeat clears of some dungeons
	this might require generated towns to "depend" on what you have at the time
	
town's dungeons, quests, etc. should be computed after clicking it. Need "town mechanics" as well.
